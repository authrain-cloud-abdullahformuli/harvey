"""The signal vocabulary Harvey proposes, and the user confirms.

Harvey never decides on its own what makes a good prospect. It proposes a
catalog of signals it knows how to collect — each with a plain-language
description, what it costs, and why it might matter — and the user confirms,
edits, or rejects them in the dashboard before any collection runs.

Only ``confirmed`` signals get collected. That keeps spend intentional and
keeps the resulting cohorts explainable: a prospect list is a query over
signals a human chose, not a black box.

Design note: every signal is recorded as an OBSERVATION (a row), never a
column. A new signal needs no migration, history comes free, and confidence
and provenance travel with the fact.
