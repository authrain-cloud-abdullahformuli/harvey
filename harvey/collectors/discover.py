"""DISCOVER — who exists, and how visible they are.

The only stage that costs money, so it is the one with a provider menu, a
mandatory cost estimate, and a budget check inside the loop.

Two shapes of discovery, and the difference matters:

* **Listings** ask "which businesses of this type are in this place?" and come
  back with a phone, a category, a rating and — crucially — whether there is a
  website at all. For local SMB verticals this is the primary path.
* **SERP** asks "who ranks for this search?" and comes back with a rank
  position. You are buying the *signal*, not the list: positions 11-30 are
  businesses visible enough to be trying and not winning, which is the most
  useful prospecting signal there is.

Cost discipline lives here, not in the database. A table can only record spend
after the fact; only the collector can decline to spend it. Every run
estimates first, checks a budget between batches, reads the kill switch, and
flushes observations per batch — a long run that dies must not lose what it
already learned.

        studios. A search this source cannot answer has to say so; filling the
        database with plausible-looking junk is far worse than returning
