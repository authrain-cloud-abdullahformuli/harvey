"""Mail provider abstraction — Harvey owns its sending, Instantly optional.

A MailProvider gives Harvey full inbox control: send, read replies,
thread. Two native providers ship:

- ``gmail``  — a Google Workspace / Gmail mailbox via the Gmail REST API
  (recommended: a real mailbox on a dedicated secondary domain is the
  most deliverable way to send <50 cold emails/day).
- ``smtp``   — any mailbox that speaks SMTP + IMAP (AgentMail, Fastmail,
  a Workspace app-mailbox, self-hosted). Configuration via .env.

``instantly`` remains supported through the legacy Sender/Handler path —
it isn't a MailProvider because Instantly owns sequencing/sending itself.
