"""The prospecting pipeline: DISCOVER → PROFILE → (people, verification).

Each stage is independently runnable and independently re-runnable. That is
the point of the design, not an accident of it: profiling can re-run without
re-buying discovery, and discovery can widen without re-profiling everyone.

What chains them is a *query*, not a hand-off. PROFILE asks the database
"which companies have I not looked at, or not looked at lately?" rather than
being handed a list by DISCOVER. So a profile run started for any reason
picks up whatever discovery left behind, a crashed run resumes by itself, and
re-observing on a schedule turns the same signal into a time series.

Segment before you enrich: enrichment cost scales with list size and
conversion does not, so profile the businesses you would actually contact,
not every row you hold.
